# iotscanner

This project was created as part of my final year project at university. I have no plans to continue development of this project however I recently received a request to make the repo public - I am therefore making this project free for private/non-commercial use/research use.

iotscanner makes use of [libnmap](https://github.com/savon-noir/python-libnmap) to perform scans of a target network - it should only be used against networks you own or have express permission to perform port scanning against, do not use this software to scan a network you have not been given permission to target.
